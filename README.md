# My Sabbatical 2019
### An overview of my goals and accomplishments during the 1st sabbatical of my career! ⭐⭐⭐

*** Note: an explicit ethos* I held during this time was to explore and settle into the idea of not viewing my life as a series of accomplishments on the meritocracy hampster wheel. Thus, this document lived as a messy, haphazard outline in my Google Drive and Evernote for the majority of the duration of my sabbatical. I did not expect myself to "have it all together" as I went, I built the plane you see below while I was flying it. I wanted to extend myself such creative freedom and self-compassion during my sabbatical. I hope others who may look at this overview while considering a sabbatical or learning about a sabbatical for someone they love might extend such grace to themselves and to the people they love.

*This TED Talk by David Brooks summarizes many elements of the ethos I held during my sabbatical: 🤓 https://www.ted.com/talks/david_brooks_the_lies_our_culture_tells_us_about_what_matters_and_a_better_way_to_live

📝 About Sabbaticals
A sabbatical is traditionally defined as a "paid leave granted to a professional for study or travel, usually one year for every 7 years worked." The concept dates back to ancient agriculture traditions and the Biblical practice of shmita, where people are required take a year-long break after working in the fields every 7 years. With 11% of American companies offering unpaid sabbatical benefits, and 5% offering paid sabbatical benefits (according to the 2019 Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM) Employee Benefits Survey representing nearly 3,000 companies) and over 2 years already spent trying to work out a sabbatical with a company that didn't offer a formal program, taking one for myself seems like the best possible outcome for my career long term.

# CS-MBA-MEd Curriculum
In a more ideal world, the formal education system would have a place for me to retrain as a near 30 something with a dynamic, modern set of interests, without going into absurd amounts of student debt. Because that world doesn't currently exist, I have created the curriculum and structure of my dreams for myself through a combination of online and in person courses, films, travel, and activities.
