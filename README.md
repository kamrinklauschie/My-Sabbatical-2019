# My Sabbatical 2019
#### An overview of my goals and accomplishments during the 1st sabbatical of my career! ⭐⭐⭐

#### About Sabbaticals 📝
A sabbatical is typically defined as a "paid leave granted to a professional for study or travel, usually one year for every 7 years worked." The concept dates back to ancient regenerative agricultural traditions and the Biblical practice of shmita, where people were required take a year-long break every 7 years: a beautiful, necessary ritual dedicated to the healthfulness and rebirth of both the fields and the humans who tended to them. 🌱

As of 2019, 11% of American companies offer unpaid sabbatical benefits, and 5% offer paid sabbatical benefits (according to the 2019 Society for Human Resource Management, or SHRM, Employee Benefits Survey representing nearly 3,000 American companies). In other words, in today's productivity and hustle focused world, sabbaticals are rare and underutilized. 💎

#### About Burnout 🧯
In the 1st quarter of 2019, a number of articles about burnout went viral online ("How Milennials Became the Burnout Generation" on BuzzFeed, "Milennials Are Screwed" on HuffPo Highline, and "Against Hustle Culture" on NYT, to name a few). By May 2019, the World Health Organization announced burnout's inclusion in the 11th Revision of the International Classification of Diseases. Burnout is an occupational syndrome involving chronic apathy, detachment, isolation, irritability, anger, and forgetfulness. 🔥

#### Why Now? Why Me? ⏰
I spent most of my 20s surviving working very hard in incredibly chaotic startups. AngelHack barely survived the national PR crisis created by it's "tech bro" founder who I worked with, while watching all my friends and colleagues get fired. Samasource limped along, suffered layoffs, and sold off Samahope, while I furiously worked what amounted to 3 full time jobs trying to keep up with Leila Janah. Dev Bootcamp and Learners Guild both shut down amongst the overexpansion of the bootcamp training industry, despite our team's success advocating for the expansion of corporate apprenticeship programs. I spun out my own company in hopes we could continue that success B2B, only to fight endlessly with my cofounders over basic interpersonal relationship dynamics that hurt and belittled me. 

In the aftermath of those 7 years of work, it became exceptionally clear I was burned out and depressed. It became exceptionally clear dedicating myself for years to a company in hopes they might give me a sabbatical was a recipe for disappointment. It became exceptionally clear working towards my professional development goals part time would not result in the kind of progress I wanted. It became exceptionally clear that if I didn't choose to invest in myself, no one else would.

I had a choice: I could continue advocating for the development of other's careers until I no longer existed, except for a depressed, burned out shell of my former self, or I could take a sabbatical and do the damn thing myself. I - finally - after years of battling against myself, against finding the resources, against never being granted permission by organizations or people, chose to take my sabbatical for myself.

#### Note: an explicit ethos* I held during this time was to explore and settle into the idea of not viewing my life as a series of accomplishments on the meritocracy workaholism hampster wheel. Thus, this document lived as a messy, haphazard outline in my Google Drive and Evernote for the majority of the duration of my sabbatical. I did not expect myself to "have it all together" as I went, I built the plane you see below while I was flying it. I wanted to extend myself such creative freedom and self-compassion during my sabbatical. I hope others who may look at this overview while considering a sabbatical or learning about a sabbatical for someone they love might extend such grace to themselves and to the people they love.

# CS-MBA-MEd Curriculum
In a more ideal world, the formal education system would have a place for me to retrain as a near 30 something with a dynamic, modern set of interests, without going into absurd amounts of student debt. Because that world doesn't currently exist, I have created the curriculum and structure of my dreams for myself through a combination of online and in person courses, films, travel, and activities.
