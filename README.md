# CS-MBA-MEd Curriculum
In a more ideal world, the formal education system would have a place for me to retrain and learn as a soon-to-be 30 something with a dynamic, modern set of interests, without going into absurd amounts of student debt. Because that world doesn't currently exist, I have created it for myself through a combination of online and in person courses, films, and activities.
